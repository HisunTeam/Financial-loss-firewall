# I. What is a Financial Firewall?

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid development of industries like e-commerce, internet finance, and mobile payments, enterprises are handling a large volume of financial transactions daily. The occurrence of financial risks due to system vulnerabilities, bugs, or human errors is not uncommon. There is an urgent need for these platforms to automatically and real-time detect these hidden financial risks. Thus, our Financial Firewall System was developed.

The Financial Firewall System utilizes real-time streaming monitoring technology to automatically monitor and analyze the flow of funds. It can monitor abnormal behavior and amounts in the transaction process in real-time, triggering immediate alerts to take corrective measures and avoid financial losses. With this system, enterprises can safely and reliably reduce financial risks, protect themselves from potential economic losses, and focus on business development without worries.

This system is not only applicable to financial transactions but also to risk auditing, sensitive information checks, blacklist management, data analysis, and the implementation of Flink applications.

It is mainly applicable to industries such as finance, e-commerce, telecommunications, payments, insurance, securities, retail, logistics, and government affairs.

The design philosophy of the Financial Firewall System is based on the rapidly developing mobile internet market environment, aiming to be a control platform that identifies financial loss risks in real-time and sends alerts. Its design philosophy and advantages include:

1. **Real-time Risk Identification**: The Financial Firewall can monitor and analyze the flow of funds in real-time, perform data comparisons and analysis through a configured rule engine, and identify potential financial loss risks in real-time. This real-time risk identification can help users take timely measures to prevent further losses.
2. **Customizable Rules**: The Financial Firewall provides flexible rule configuration functions, allowing users to create verification rules customized to their business characteristics and risk management needs, meeting various business scenario requirements.
3. **Multi-source Data Integration**: The Financial Firewall supports multiple data source types (Oracle, Mysql, etc.), such as banking systems, payment systems, etc., allowing for flexible integration of different sources of financial data. This enables users to analyze information from different data sources comprehensively, enhancing the detection capability of financial risks.
4. **Diverse Alarm Mechanisms**: The Financial Firewall is equipped with a comprehensive alarm management system, capable of sending timely alerts when abnormalities are detected. Alarms support various notification methods such as WeChat, email, phone, SMS, Feishu, etc., with customized alarm methods and content according to the level of the alarm recipient, ensuring that key personnel can receive risk information in time. Additionally, alarm management also provides alarm log recording and analysis, facilitating subsequent problem troubleshooting and analysis for users.
5. **Visual Monitoring and Intelligent Verification**: The Financial Firewall usually provides an intuitive visual interface, facilitating users to manage system monitoring and risk verification. Users can view real-time financial risk status, alarm information, historical records, etc., through the interface, thereby better understanding and mastering the situation of financial risks.
